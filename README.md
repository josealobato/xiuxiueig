# Project "xiuxiueig"

> This project is under initial development

The "xiuxiueig" project is an iOS app to help dyslexic students keep up with their lessons. It will allow them to manage a library of audio snippets for their studies and automatically schedule their study sessions.

**"Xiuxiueig"** means whisper in [Catalan](https://www.wordreference.com/definicio/xiuxiueig). The name was chosen by **my son Pau**.

> Developer's note: This project is over-engineered. It could have been developed with a simple architecture and a more direct implementation. Still, I use it to practice architecture skills and experiment with new ideas. It also means that it will evolve as I practice new things.

## On Naming

The prefix `X` or `XX` is used to identify public containers or types designed exclusively for the app. It is used to avoid conflicts with other systems or imported types. Internal types won't generally use any prefixes.
