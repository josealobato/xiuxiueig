/// Public interface of the Media File System allowing accessing the existing file
/// by state (managed, unmanaged,...), and allowing to modify the file and change its state.
///
/// # How to use it.
///
/// Use the builder to get an instance of this interface.
/// Once done that you can access the media files by interacting with the methods here.
///
/// ## Accessing existing media files
///
/// The first thing that you can do is to get the new files (`unmanagedFiles`) and the ones that
/// are already under th control of the system (`managedFiles`)
///
/// ## Changing the state (managed, unmanaged, archived) of media files
///
/// Once you have access to the files you can change their state (new, managed, archived) using the
/// corresponding methods. The regular flow of a file is:
///
/// ``` new -> managed <-> archived ```
///
/// Notice that once a file has been managed, you can not return it to new but you can archive
/// and unarchive the file at will.
///
/// ## About deleting files
///
/// You can also delete file no matter the state.
///
/// ## About demo media files
///
/// On first creation the system will create the containers to allocate the files and also add some
/// demo or tutorial files. If they are deleted you can force to recreate them with `resetDefaultMediaFiles`.
/// By default the files are located in new files to show the user the whole flow with files.
///

    /// Update a file name in the file system with the new information.
    /// Any file can be updated independently of it location, but is should be ready
    /// to be managed which means that it should be previously given and id and a name.
    /// Update file won't change the location of the file just its name.
    ///
    /// NOTE: Use updateFile only on managed files. Why? Because using it on a `isNew`
    ///       file will return a `isNew` file and those files do not have ID. 
    ///       Imagine you modify
    ///       the ID and the Name of a `isNew` file. When you update the file, 
    ///       you will change the name but the returned MediaFile will be still
    ///       `isNew` so the ID is gone and the id-name will be the name.
    /// NOTE: When you update the file you are physically moving the file, any old list of
    ///       files got from `manageFiles` or `unmanagedFiles` might containt incorrect
    ///       files.
    ///       so, do not keep these list our update always using those methods after
    ///       any other
    ///       modifying method.
