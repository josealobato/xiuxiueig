/// The `Preferences` protocol is to be use anywhere we need to persist preferences.

/// **How to use it:**
///
/// NOTE: The the engine should be initialized first (see README.md)
///
/// You should always declare your setting before using it and provide a default value.
/// If the key was already in place it will do nothing.
///
/// ```swift
/// preferences.declarePreference(key: "MessageEditor.CheckboxStatus",
///                               defaultValue: false,
///                               mode: .restricted)
/// ```
///
/// From that moment on you can read or write freely:
///
/// ```swift
/// //...
/// checkboxStatus = preferences.preference(for: "MessageEditor.CheckboxStatus")
/// //...
/// preferences.savePreference(for: "MessageEditor.CheckboxStatus", value: checkboxStatus)
/// //...
/// ```
///
/// **Technical note:**
/// This is a generic interface so it needs the type to use the right method. When giving `nil`
/// values you can indicate the type with `nil as <Type>?`, as follows:
/// ```swift
/// preferences.declarePreference(key: "APref", defaultValue: nil as Bool?, mode: .universal)
/// preferences.savePreference(for: "APref", value: nil as Bool?)
/// ```
